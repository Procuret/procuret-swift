# Introduction

Procuret API Swift (PS) allows you to perform Procuret API operations in
Swift code. For example, you might like to look up the prices of Procuret
Instalment Plan products, and present them to customers in your e-commerce
software.

Procuret Swift is the open-source component of the [Procuret iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/procuret/id1634745293).

## Versioning and public interfaces

PS follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) conventions. At any time,

guaranteed.
